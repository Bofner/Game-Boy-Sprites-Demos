# Game Boy Sprites Demos
 All demos I made for my Game Boy Sprites video
 
 Some of these demos were used with the overlays feature from Emulicious to show off specific coordinates and such.
 
 I've excluded the simple demos I made using Super Mario Land 2's assets, since I don't own those assets.

 Code is repurposed from an early version of the Space Tonbow Engine, hence the "Tonbow Entity Class" etc. For future files I may rename this to something more accurate, but it's kind of a hastle, so just know that names of objects reflect that.

 If you have any questions about the code, feel free to contact me at a.bofner@gmail.com
